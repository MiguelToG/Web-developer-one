		<h2>Cats are Much Safer Indoors</h2>
		
		<p class="quote">It’s a fact that an inside cat lives a longer, healthier life than the cat that puts paws on the pavement.</p> 
		
		<p>An indoor cat never faces the dozens of dangers waiting outside your front door like cars, other cats ready to fight for love or territory, exposure to diseases and parasites, and sickness or death from eating spoiled food or poison.</p> 
		
		<p>Not all people are kind to cats running around the neighborhood as well, this may be one of their biggest dangers.</p>

		<h2>The Happy Homecoming</h2>
		
		<p class="quote">Don’t let the new cat peeking out of its cagew cat meet any other animals or people in your household until they are safely put into their own room.  Keep the kennel covered to reduce stress.</p>

		<p>
			Just set the kennel down in their room with the door closed and open the kennel door, quietly back away and wait.  Let them come out of the kennel on their own time, everything is very frightening to them.</p>

		<p>
			They have to adjust to the sight, sounds and smell of their new environment.  Sit quietly and patiently in the room and wait for them to come out, it may take several hours be prepared to wait or quietly leave the room, leave a small light on and let them settle down for a few hours before you re-enter.</p>
